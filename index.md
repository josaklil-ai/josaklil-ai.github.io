## About Me

**Currently**, I'm a Biomedical Data Science PhD student @[Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/) where I'm grateful to be advised by Prof. [Serena Yeung-Levy](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/) in the [MARVL](https://marvl.stanford.edu/index.html) lab. My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and healthcare, centered in computer vision models for surgical skill assessment, training, and feedback. I'm also more generally interested in video understanding and multimodal models in biomedicine. I've interned with Hoifung's group @[Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hoifung/).

**Previously**, I received my Bachelor's in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics @[University of Denver](https://www.du.edu/) with a Distinction in Computer Science.
